        <p>
          The images above are of four mochi balls, however, they are unqiue as
          they are made up of different files. The first file is a jpeg image,
          which is a low storage photo. The second is a gif, which is a moving
          animation, but its a little lower quality. The third is a png, which
          is a higher quality image that supports transparent pixels, but cant
          be enlarged or modified. The last is an svg, which is a vector image
          and can be manipulated freely wihtout losing image quality.
